            Want to cultivate a broad vocabulary and boost pronunciation in a new language? LingoHut is the right place for you!
            What is LingoHut?
            LingoHut is a family-led project for language and culture that goes beyond borders.

            It is a website that helps you find vocabulary, spelling, and pronunciation in carefully organized topics. A perfect resource for completely new, A1, and A2 learners to gain more confidence in listening and pronunciation. All recordings are from a native speaker of the language giving a natural understanding of pronunciation.


            LingoHut as a tool is simple and powerful, especially for beginners of a language. Get used to the sounds and pronunciation, practice pronunciation alongside, and start gaining an understanding of spelling and reading through short phrases and words. Reinforce your knowledge by playing a variety of games at the end of each lesson.

            It is 100% free-to-use and our gift to language learners.

            It provides access to learn 50 languages, through a variety of games and lessons to learn.

            Because LingoHut is not an average “learn a new language” site, it is a moving story of how learning a new language can transform you, and WE want to help you learn, grown, and speak with confidence.

            LingoHut is a place for all.

            Come learn to communicate in 1 or all 50 languages and read our blogs on our language journey.
